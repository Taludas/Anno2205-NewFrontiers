# FAQ
1. **When do I unlock the Mars?**

    The new storyline to reach the Mars is unlocked after you have completed the Main Story of 2205. The Quest will then ask you to finish the Sector Quest for the "Greentide Archipelago" to unlock Synthetics. Afterwards, the Second Mars Mission begins which will eventually take you to the Red Planet.

2. **What is the difference between "Services" and "Urbanisation"? How do I fulfill these needs?**

    Services are a newly introduced product that can only be produced by Public Buildings. I created them to overhaul and diversify the 2205 Public Building game mechanic. While the first community centers on Earth and in the Arctic operate without input goods to start with, you will need to supply your higher level Public Buildings with certain goods in order to produce services. The more sophisticated the inputs, the more services the building will produce.

    While it's theoretically possible to supply an Investor City with Community Centers alone, you'd need so many of them that there wouldn't be much room left for houses. Also, this is where Urbanisation comes into play. Urbanisation is basically the "old" way, Public Buildings worked in 2205. The concept is the same as in Logistics. Your houses must be built close to Urban Centers (i.e. Public Buildings) in order to meet their Urbanisation needs. Factories also provide a certain amount of Urbanisation, so - if you like it - you have an incentive to build them into your cities as well. However, most of the Urbanisation is generated by Public Buildings, and the higher the level, the more you get. I kept this mechanic in place to prevent players from following the hypothesis of piling up a lot of Public Buildings at one end of the map and building the city at the other.

3. **Why are some of my buildings locked without unlock condition shown?**

    You have discovered one of the new mechanics I introduced in the Orbit DLC, where certain buildings are locked behind research in the Technology Nexus. As Anno cannot adequately display the unlocking requirements of a building if the unlocking condition is anything other than "have x amount of population level y", I have created five additional quests to guide you on your way to unlocking these buildings. You can find them on the left-hand side, just below the main quest tracker, as soon as they are relevant to your progress.

    All five buildings will simplify the production process and logistics costs of certain goods. For example: The AI Assembly Hall, which produces Cybersynth Circuits, is initially locked on the Moon, even though you need it to produce BioEnhancers for your Executives. For now, you will have to rely on the more expensive AI Assembly Hall in the Tundra Region and ship them to the Moon for processing. However, by researching the level 3 tech of the linking tree between the standard Biotech and Electronics techs, you can unlock this building on the Moon, greatly simplifying the production chain. If you also research Aeroponic Farming on the Moon, you can produce all the inputs for the Cybersynth circuits on the Moon, drastically reducing the logistical costs involved in producing BioEnhancers.

4. **Why are additional secondary modules like the drone hive modules THAT expensive?**

    I have decided to reintroduce the rare materials as well as additional - more specific - building materials into the secondary module costs. A major gameplay loop in 2205 is the constant balancing of workforce, energy and credits. I feel that this change to the building costs, by restricting access to the maintenance reduction modules to the mid to late game, improves this gameplay loop beyond that of the original game.

    Example: In the late Operator - early Executive stage, you will most likely struggle to keep up with the increased labour costs of maintaining your production facilities. To overcome this obstacle, you cannot just spam the five reduction modules on the cheap. You need to build a proper Smart Drones production chain in the Tundra first and ship them to the other sectors before you can take advantage of these modules. Of course, you could just build more houses, but that would also require additional work...

    **TL:DR** The material costs have been increased to make the game more complex. Finding ways to reduce the cost of maintaining your factories has become more important than in the base game.
    By the way, have you noticed that the useless logistics module has been replaced with the actually relevant finance calculator to reduce the maintenance costs of non-energy buildings?

# Known Issues

**Base game:**
- The four new products (Organic Food, Fine Food, Sustenance Packs and Thermal Shells) cannot be traded with the world market.
- There are five quests to guide you to do specific research to unlock certain buildings as the "Unlock Condition" tooltip only works with population milestones. Unfortunately those quests will be visible in all sessions, not only in those the buildings are located in.
- Certain Secondary Module tooltips will not show the correct tooltip description (i.e. Energy module on Energy Production buildings giving +15% output, or Mars Research Lab modules)
- The population overview filter in the strategic view does not work properly with the new Arctic Tier 3. It does not show the correct portrait next to the number. Same goes for the Martian Synthetics.
- Services are a new "product". The balance can not be shown in the "usual" balance menu, otherwise they would be tradeable via trade route. Instead you can find them in the building material bar at the top or click on any Public Building and hover over the "Globe" icon to see the current sector balance.
- Company Headquarter infotip in the bottom of the screen seems to be hardcoded and displays tier 2, 3 and 4 public needs although those have been removed from the game.
- Factories that produce Urbanisation as a site-product cannot be paused anymore.
- Selecting a mining site on the Moon will only show 5 possible entries in the UI. As there are now 6 mines in total, the Regolith Gatherer can only be build via buildmenu.
- Increased storage for Rare Resource Generators only comes into effect after collecting the resources once. Therefore always wait until the first unit has been generated and collect it immediately after building to set the storage amount to the modded one.
- The UI of the Astronaut Training Camps have been changed to that of a standard factory to support the display of extra goods generated by activating the tier 5 Heavy Industry tech "Orbital Warehouses". Unfortunately this leads to an issue, where the output of the Astronauts is shown with "0 per minute". This is only a visual issue. The Camp still trains 25 Astronauts per full 10 minute cycle on 100% productivity. You can view the cumulated numbers per session in the Orbital Station tooltip shown on the left site of your money once you have build one Training Camp. Same goes for the time till the next supply flight to the Station. This is now exclusive to the aforementioned UI.

**Mars Sector:** Due to the way, Mars Sector is coded to be part of the Moon region, some issues arise from this specifically:
- Mars sector takes longer than other sectors to load.
- The unlock notification for new buildings on the Moon has been changed, so that all newly unlocked Moon buildings will show up as "New Moon Buildings" in the notification.
- To manage the build menu and to restrict Mars buildings to the Mars sector, I had to use a workaround by locking the Moon buildings when entering the Mars session. When you leave the Mars session (for example to adjust trade routes), you will get a notification, that again "New Moon Buildings" have been unlocked. I already shortened the notification by using the "New Moon Buildings" pool, but if I disable them completely, you will get no notification on first unlock.
- After entering the Mars sector and open the build menu, you regularly need to select "Martian Synthetics" tab again to see the available buildings.
- Pressing the Hotkey for "Build Street" on the Mars will result in the Moon Tracks instead of the expected Mars Tracks. Pipette it or use the build menu entry to lay down Mars Tracks instead.
- Using the buildings filter tab next to the minimap (the population button) in the Mars Session will lead to a game freeze, only resolvable by killing the task.
- The Mars sector has some unique sector traits available. Notice, that on entering the sector, the welcome UI shows a random Moon trait instead of the Martian one. That one will only be given to the sector on first enter. You can reroll the sector trait by completing a special quest. This involves delivering certain products to your space port. Notice that the usual way of rerolling sector traits will result in a random trait from the Moon!
- Mars Meteors use Moon ground textures.
- While loading the Mars Sector icon will change to a white rectangle. After clicking for loading, click anywhere on the strategic view again to get the icon back.
- Whenever Mars season changes and you are in another sector, the time of day will change to that one used by the Martian season effect on its own accord. You can adjust the time via the camera menu next to the minimap.
- Whenever Mars season changes and you are in another sector, the time of day will change to that one used by the Martian season effect on its own accord. You can adjust the time via the camera menu next to the minimap.
- If you use the Geo-Engineering quest on Mars, the script may randomly choose to apply the same trait that is already active. This will cause the sector to lose its trait altogether. In that case, you can use the console to reapply the effect. The GUIDs can be found [here](/en/Anno2205/SectorTraits.md). First, enter the Mars session. Now press Shift+F1 to open the console and type `debug.toggleSectorEffect(GUID)` using the corresponding number of the wanted trait. Press enter and close the console with Shift+F1 again.
- Sometimes, Martian Season effects can randomly start on the Moon/Earth. This is a problem, as they last for a very long time and cannot be resolved with a quest. Again, you need to use the console to get rid of them, if it happens to you: First, enter the session in question. Now press Shift+F1 to open the console and type `debug.toggleSectorEffect(GUID)`. Proceed to replace the "GUID" placeholder with the corresponding GUID from the currently active season effect (see below). Press enter and close the console with Shift+F1 again. The effect should be gone.
- Sometimes, Martian Season effects can end up mismatched with the current season quest. If you currently suffer from mismatched season effect to the shown season quest in the quest tracker on the left side of the screen, you have to use the console to fix this:
> 1. Press Shift+F1 to open the console.
> 2. Enter (without any typing errors, pay attention to upper and lower case!), replace "CurrentSeasonGUID" with the correct number from the table below:
`debug.startSectorEffect(CurrentSeasonGUID,19990093)`
> 3. Press Enter
> 4. Enter (without any typing errors, pay attention to upper and lower case!), , replace "CorrectSeasonGUID" with the correct number from the table below:
`debug.startSectorEffect(CorrectSeasonGUID,19990093)`
> 5. Press Shift+F1 to close the console.
> 6. The sector effect should now match the current season quest.

  |Season|Summer|Autumn|Winter|Spring|
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  |GUID|19990307|19990378|19990370|19990374|

- Sometimes Drake's invasions bug out after unlocking Mars. Apparently he tries to invade there(?) (which is not possible because there is no sea there obviously to put his ships upon). The quest description doesn't contain the usual sector name, and the quest log shows the requirement to destroy -1/1 ships and no invasion force is in any sector to clear them out. However, sometimes the quest resolves automatically if you enter "the correct" sector (which is not visible/logically deducible). If this happens to you it is best practice to end this invasion quest via the console to prevent possible damage:
> 1. Select the quest in the outliner (active quest, showing all details).
> 2. Press Shift+F1 to open the console.
> 3. Type `quests.reachSelectedQuest()` and press enter.
> 4. The quest should resolve. Close the console with Shift+F1 again.

    - **Additional Mars Session**
       - It can be found in the upper right corner of the strategic view. It is accessible after completing a new questline available once you have completed the Lunar Licensing Program and the Greentide Archipelago's sector story questline surrounding the Synths.
       - Add 10 New Mars Sector Traits for the new sector. One trait is distributed to it randomly on first entry. With a special geo-engineering quest you can reroll the sector trait as well (Warning: normal rerolling results in Moon Traits!) For details see: [here](#overhauled-sector-traits)
       - Add 4 seasons to the Mars session, which cycle in regular intervals. Each season has its own unique calamity effect that the player will have to deal with. To compensate for the increased difficulty, each season also has a bonus for certain buildings:

    - **New Main Quests**
      - *"30. The AI Revolution": Settle 50000 Synthetics*

        As humanity craves for even more galactic expansion after your successful Moon colonization, the daunting challenge to conduct a second mission to Mars and of sustaining life in the harsh Martian environment presents itself once again. As there is no chance that humans can survive this journey with current technology, the Global Union presents you with the task to develop an advanced artificial intelligence that is capable to overcome the formidable obstacles of interplanetary travel and colonization.

      - *"31. The Second Mars Mission": Settle 10000 Geniuses and upgrade your Transmission Spaceport in one of your Moon sectors with a Mars Launcher.*

        After more than one hundred years, you are chosen to ready humanity for its second expedition to the Red Planet. Extensive research conducted by your foremost aerospace engineers is imperative for the development of a robust rocket system capable of enduring the arduous journey to Mars.

      - *"32.  The First Martian AI Colony": Settle 1000 Martian Synths.*

        Congratulations! Once more, you've surpassed expectations with excellence in executing the second mission to mars. Your inaugural Synthetics have successfully treaded upon the surface of the Red Planet. Ensure an ample provision of goods and resources to maintain your androids amidst the dusty Martian environment. Continue in expanding your first colony to allow exploiting the ample resources of this unknown ground and build up a strong additional Expertise gain to support your Orbital Station.

      - *"33. Maintaining the Colony": Build a Martian Research Cluster and generate your first Expertise on Mars*

        Now that you've built up a decent workforce, let's start producing some things locally to ensure your Androids can survive in the harsh Martian climate. Our ultimate goal is to be self-sufficient in the production of services. This is a multi-step process that will also familiarise you with the functions of the Martian Research Laboratories. Our first step is the construction of a small research hub.

      - *"33.1 Maintaining the Colony": Build an Energy Research Laboratory and produce Natural Gas on Mars*

        We can support the production of Expertise by building additional Research Labs on Mars. Each specialisation has it's own input goods and produces a specific output product in addition to the usual Expertise. The loop to produce Services starts with the Energy Lab, that produces Gas from the locally mined Methane Ice.

      - *"33.2 Maintaining the Colony": Build an Agricultural Research Laboratory and produce Nutrient Powder on Mars*

        The next step is agricultural research, which is necessary to support the most basic forms of life on Mars: Corals and Moss. Start by filtering some of the Methane Ice for some residual Water, which you can then use to grow the very first plants on Mars - the foundation for human life on Mars!

      - *"33.3 Maintaining the Colony": Build a Heavy Industry Research Laboratory and produce Multispec Prisms on Mars*

        With one of the ingredients for Cybersynth Circuits out of the way, let's start digging up some Martian dust to scour for the rare resources that are hidden beneath its rusty crust. We need these to manufacture high quality lenses for further mineral processing.

      - *"33.4 Maintaining the Colony": Build an Electronics Research Laboratory and produce Silicon on Mars*

        Equipped with the appropriate lenses, you will be able to start analysing and separating all of the rare resources of the Red Planet for further use in the production of Cybersynth Circuits.

      - *"33.5 Maintaining the Colony": Build a Biotech Research Laboratory and produce Cybersynth Circuits on Mars*

        You have done it! The final preparations are complete and the first locally produced Cybersynth Circuits are rolling out of your Biotech Lab! This is the crucial step towards basic self-sustaining Android life on Mars - your machines will be able to analyse, repair and improve themselves without you having to intervene. With your Martian colony now fully equipped with research labs of all kinds, it is highly recommended that you strengthen your Martian population and continue on this path to total knowledge!

      - *"The Martian AI Research Program - Steps 1 to 15": Settle 75000 Martian Synths in total.*

        By increasing your population of Synths on the Mars you can now unlock more Workshop- and Module-Permits to expand the capabilities of your Orbital Station even further: Per 5000 Martian Synths you unlock 1 extra workshop permit for your Orbital Station along with some more modules and connectors. A total of 14 additional permits can be gained, so that you can now fully exploit the Nexus' research capabilities by building 5 workshops of each specialisation. Upon reaching the maximum required population you unlock the technology to geo-engineer the Mars' sector trait to a random new one.

    - **Moon Aeroponic Farms and Food Production**

        One of the new features on the Moon is the possibility to produce any farming product through Aeroponic Farms. Those need to be unlocked first in the Nexus (Agriculture-Biotech tier 3). The Aeroponic Farm requires Water and Oxygen to operate. With this mod there is the option to produce Water on Moon from Moonice and Nano-Ceramics. Aeroponic Farms can produce a multiple of their counterparts on the earth.
        Another option with this mod is to produce part of your Food needs on the Moon as well. Sustenance Packs and Luxury Food are available. For the first one and Oxygen, I have introduced a new Aluminum Mine to the Moon. Luxury Food production chain on the Moon needs Organic Food and Wine. Organic Food can be produced here as well, from Rice and Vegetables using the Aeroponic Farming System.

        - Aeroponic Farms Moon (one for each crop type)
        ![newfarmsmoon](https://github.com/Taludas/Anno-2205-New-Frontiers-Mod/assets/64583643/41c95ec1-2dc2-4eba-a441-b9988d702a62)

3. ## Quality of Life Improvements
   - You can now open the ingame console by pressing Left Shift + F1. Some commands can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno2205/mods/1?tab=description). While having basic autocomplete, notice that the console is not tolerant to spelling errors or incorrectly formatted arguments. The game will freeze in those cases.
   - All cutscene videos can be skipped by pressing escape. Same goes for Ubisoft logo and intro movie. Fade out duration has been shortened.
   - <details>
      <summary>Removed annoying NPC reminder messages</summary>

      Several NPC reminder messages have been removed, since they are quite intrusive and come in to short intervals for my liking:
      - Docks Reminder: John Rafferty does not remind you to upgrade your ships anymore.
      - Arctic Custodians: Hovard Young will not remind you that "This building plot is at your disposal" every time you build a mine or a coastal building in the Arctic.
      - Event Sectors: removed starting/reminder messages from the Mysterious Lady, trader Jorgensen, John Rafferty, Hovard Young
      - Voting: removed start/reminder messages from the Mysterious Lady (voting is broken anyways...)
      - Orbital Station: removed the annoying notifications every time the space shuttle launches with a new batch of Astronauts (why in the first place would you need to know this?!) as well as the regular message if you float Expertise.
      - Tundra: removed "welcome back" message from Esther Nylund every time you enter the sector after initial unlock.
      - Share Market: removed most basic AI starting and winning notifications.
     </details>
   - Changed World Market Route Durations from 2 hours to 12 hours (world market price adjustments are broken anyways...), reminder notification for route expiration shortened to 5 minutes before ending, expiration offer timer is unchanged at 2 minutes before expiration.
   - Increase the storage capacity (999) and production rate (1/min) of all rare resource generators (Sector Quest rewards)

4. ## Changes to the base game including Tundra and Frontiers DLC
   - Exchanged Drink and Food need position in the UI for Worker tier to match the new setup for Operators.
   - Changed Construction costs and build time for all Monumental Bridges:

    |Bridge No.|Build Time|Build Cost|Finalization Cost|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |<div align=center>1</div>|10 minutes|25t/min Superalloys <br> 750 workforce|150000 credits <br> 100 Graphene|
    |<div align=center>2</div>|20 minutes|50t/min Superalloys <br> 1500 workforce|300000 credits <br> 125 Graphene|
   
   - Lowered the required balance for the very last quest of the sector project in Walbruck Basin from +50k to +25k as the original one was quite hard to achieve in higher difficulty runs before having >150k Investors.
   - <details>
     <summary>Overhauled effects and build costs of Secondary Modules.</summary>

      - removed the logistics module as it is quite useless.
      - added the Finance Calculator known from energy buildings to all productions, reducing credit maintenance.
      - replaced the logistics module of energy buildings with a new Accumulator Unit, increasing the productivity by 15% each.
      - adjusted build costs: every module now uses the region's rare resource (energy module uses Iridium). Workforce modules now cost SmartDrones, Energy modules cost Fusion Power Cells and Credit modules cost Quantum Computers.
      - adjusted effect strength: normal versions now reduce maintenance by -10%. Special once from voting or the dominance mode -15%.
     </details>
   - VR Generators and SuperCoolants have been moved from being a Biotech product to Electronics.
   - Changed balancing of credit maintenance and income across the three difficulty settings to reflect the immensely higher maintenance costs of new products and production chains:
     <details>
      <summary>Revenue multiplier</summary>

      - Plenty: 1.5 (unchanged)
      - Medium: 1.375 (was 1.25)
      - Sparse: 1.25 (was 1.00)
     </details>
     <details>

      - Officers: 317 (was 164)
      - Tundra Ecologists: 48 (unchanged)
      - Tundra Field Researchers: 317 (was 276)
     </details>

   - Changed balancing of workforce generation to reflect the higher maintenance costs of new and overhauled factories:

      - Workers: 20/20/16 (unchanged)
      - Operators: 60/50/40 (was 70/40/32)
      - Executives: 145/135/125 (was 175/80/64)
      - Investors: 305/265/225 (was 438/160/128)
      - Synthetics: 576/480/384 (was 384/320/256)
      - Protectors: 20/20/16 (was 15/20/16)
      - Scientists: 50/40/35 (was 50/40/32)
      - Geniuses: 250/200/150 (new)
      - Miners: 20/20/16 (unchanged)
      - Officers: 50/40/32 (unchanged)
      - Tundra Ecologists: 28/26/24 (was 20/20/16)
      - Tundra Field Researchers: 56/52/48 (was 50/40/32)
     </details>

   - Changed balancing for product consumption by residents to better take into account the more complex production chains and modified outputs of certain factories:
     <details>
      <summary>Consumption multiplier</summary>

      - Sparse: 1.00 (unchanged)
      - Medium: 1.25 (was 1.50)
      - Plenty: 1.5 (was 2.00)
     </details>

   - Changed consumption values of many needs for all population levels (haven't fully figured out how the actual consumption is calculated from the values in population_balancing.xml, use the ingame statistics menu)
   - Removed "Trade Route Administration Cost" (in vanilla each trade route costs additional money, it was increased by 250 per route, cap was 10k with 4 free routes to start with)
   - Adjusted several unlock triggers to fit with the new progression of the Main Quest, new buildings and Arctic Tier 3 population:
     <details>
      <summary>Changes:</summary>

      - Vegetable Farm, Organic Food Factory, Fine Food Manufactory are unlocked with 1000 Operators
      - Sustenance Packs Factory Earth unlocks with 5000 Executives
      - Energy Transmitter Spaceport Earth/Moon needs at least 1 Genius

      - changed unlock condition of Rejuvenator Chain to 1750 Operators
      - changed the unlock condition of the Transmission Spaceport on Moon to 5000 Officers and 2500 Geniuses

     </details>

   - Changed first steps of the Questline in Tundra Region to reflect changes in population needs and Technology Nexus. Added 10 Petrochemicals as a reward for settling the first Ecologists in Tundra to make upgrading the spaceport there possible without extra work.

   - Construction costs and time have been changed for all Tundra Pumps. They now require Aluminium, Superalloys, Titanium or Titanium Plating in addition to Construct-o-Bots. Times have been shortened to 3 Minutes each, but input requirements increased. Finalization costs have been altered to include Graphene, Petrochemicals or Magnetite for the first step. Maintenance costs for the second stage have been increased and include workforce now. Time has been shortened to 6 minutes. Finalization costs for the second stage have been changed to include credits and reduce demand on Petrochemicals.

   - Changed trade route vehicles in the Tundra to "normal" cargo ships from Temperate sectors. This reduces costs for trade route maintenance especially in the early game.

   - Overhauled the Main Questline of the game to reflect all changes and additions:
     <details>

6. ## Overhauled Population Needs:
   Each Population tier requires the needs of its predecessor in addition to its own. Synthetics do not follow this logic however.

7. ## Overhauled and New Production Chains:
    - <details>
        <summary>Vitamin Drinks:</summary>

        ![productionchain_vitamindrinks](https://github.com/Taludas/Anno-2205-New-Frontiers-Mod/assets/64583643/effd5e0f-40ce-4b22-8a0e-1c3ddb6be543)

        Vitamin Drinks now require Algae, that is first processed into Nutrient Powder. It is a multi-region good, as all regions apart from the moon have an option to produce it from a different input:
          - Temperate: Algae
          - Arctic: Deep Water Corals
          - Tundra: Moss

        For the Vitamin Drinks Production, extra coastal slots are needed in the beginning, until we can branch off into the other regions.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:
        ![vitamindrinks](https://github.com/Taludas/Anno-2205-New-Frontiers-Mod/assets/64583643/3fc43d9b-4b27-4404-9ff8-1db6d2498002)

        For this Chain, two completely new products are added for the mod: Fine Food aka Sushi and Organic Food, an intermediate product in its production chain. "Original" Organic Food was renamed to Rice and is the basic Food for Workers.

        The chain starts off very basic with Water, which is needed for the Greenhouse to grow Vegetables. Vegetables and Rice are now combined in a Rice Cooker into the first of the four unused products: Organic Food. Organic Food is now combined with Fish brought in flash frozen from your first Arctic sector into Sushi inside a Sushi Rolling Factory.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:

        This production chain requires opening up the Tundra region to get access to one of the input products. Synth Cells are unchanged. The new input for the Biomedical Laboratory is Hyaluronic Acid which can only be produced in the Tundra region from Moss.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:

        Molybdenum is unchanged. Nano-Ceramics have been introduced as a second input.

        Water was introduced as a second input for the Cattle Farm. Rest is unchanged.

        Bioresin is a new input product for Microchips. Alternatively Microchips can be produced from Tungsten in the Tundra. Flax has been moved to be produced exclusively in the Tundra region as well.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:
        ![intelliwearedited](https://github.com/Taludas/Anno-2205-New-Frontiers-Mod/assets/64583643/95367c88-c949-4f29-a12a-c1ad2603ced8)

        BioEnhancers have been changed to be way more complex than in the original game. Cybersynth Circuits are now required as well as Titanium instead of Rare Earth Elements. Until you research the technology to produce the Cybersynth Circuits on the Moon, you will need to import them from the Tundra. The AI Assembly Hall on the Moon uses Rare Earth Elements instead of Microchips to produce Cybersynth Circuits.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:

        Quantum Computers now require production of Superconductors. Those can be produced only in the Arctic and require SuperCoolants and Nano-Ceramics as an input. As Quantum Computers are now required at Executive tier, the Diamond Mine is unlocked earlier than before. To produce Quantum Computers you need at least 1 Genius in the Arctic.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:

        Anti-Grav Compensators now require the input of Superconductors as well, which need to be imported from the Arctic to produce them.

        Androids now require the changed Cybersynth Circuits as well. The other input used to be Synth Cells. But as those are already part of the Cybersynth Circuit chain, they are dropped in favour of Biopolymers.

        Neural Interfaces is a completely new product introduced with the mod. It is produced exclusively in the Arctic region and requires input of MultiSpec-Prisms and Superconductors. The chain is unlocked with Geniuses. It's production building is one of the most expensive in terms of credit-, workforce- and energy maintenance in the entire game. Neural Interfaces are also required by Geniuses and Synthetics.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:

        Sustenance Packs essentially is the reworked Canned Food product from Arctic. Aluminum was added as an additional input. Sustenance Packs can also be produced on Earth from Manager Tier onwarfs to supply your first Moon Colony more easily. Here the chain uses Organic Food and Aluminum:

        The same is true for the Moon version of this chain. With Officers and the Aeroponic Farming tech from the Nexus you get the opportunity to prodce them on the Moon as well.

        Renamed Stimulants with a new icon. Instead of only using Corals, those need to be processed into Nutrient Powder first. As a second input Rare Earth Elements are necessary. Those need to be shipped from the Moon.

        Here is an overview of this chain's modified buildings:

        Smart Drones are a new need of the Scientists in the Arctic. They can only be produced in the Tundra. As I recycled the Nanometre Processors into another good, they now require Microchips instead. Those can be produced from Tungsten in the Tundra just like the Nanometre Processors used to be.

        Thermal Shells are a new clothing need for Scientists, Geniuses and Field Researchers. They are similar to IntelliWear, but require Fusion Power Cells from the Moon instead of Microchips. The new product can be produced in Arctic (requiring importing flax as well) and in Tundra regions.

        Oxygen production now requires Aluminum from the new Moon Aluminum Mine as well.

8.  ## Overhauled Public Buildings
    - Services are a newly introduced product that can only be produced by Public Buildings. I created them to overhaul and diversify the 2205 Public Building game mechanic.
    - Public buildings now take 4t/min of varying input goods to produce Services. In addition, Urbanisiation is provided passively. This product uses the "regular" 2205 Public Building mechanic.
    - The Cooporation HQ is now limited to one per sector

   - Orbit modules now produce additional Expertise in exchange for various input goods. They require 2 additional Astronauts to operate. The Buff towards the main workshop is not dependent on the supply of the module with the requested product. The heat value of the modules do not affect their Expertise production.

          - Special buildings are now locked behind research of Tier 3 technologies in the interconnecting tree of each branch.

          - Example: The AI Assembly Hall, which produces Cybersynth Circuits, is initially locked on the Moon, even though you need it to produce BioEnhancers for your Executives. For now, you will have to rely on the more expensive AI Assembly Hall in the Tundra Region and ship them to the Moon for processing. However, by researching the level 3 tech of the linking tree between the standard Biotech and Electronics techs, you can unlock this building on the Moon, greatly simplifying the production chain. If you also research Aeroponic Farming on the Moon, you can produce all the inputs for the Cybersynth circuits on the Moon, drastically reducing the logistical costs involved in producing BioEnhancers.
